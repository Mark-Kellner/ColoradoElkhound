        <p align="center">Why did we change the appearance of
        ColoradoElkhound.Com?</p>
        <p align="center">The simple answer is to provide you more information
        and an easier site to navigate than ever before.</p>
        <p align="center">We did this by making the following changes:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p align="left">We changed the interface to a menu driven site
                  to give you quick easy access to our whole website from the
                  homepage.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p align="left">We wanted to provide more information than
                  before without adding another layer of complexity to the site.
                  Our hope is we accomplished this and you'll find our website
                  to be a good resource to learn about<br>
                  Norwegian Elkhounds.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p align="left">The old site was built several years ago and
                  has became very difficult to maintain, much less to introduce
                  new material to it without impacting our operational
                  site.&nbsp; In the future new material will appear on our site
                  with minimal impact to the operation of the working site (or
                  the site that is in operation).</li>
              </ol>
            </blockquote>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="left">Our sincere hope is the changes that you see will be a
          benefit to you and that our website will be inviting and easier to
          use.&nbsp; After all the World Wide Web should be a positive
          experience and not a hassle.</p>
